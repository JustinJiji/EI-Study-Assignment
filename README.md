## Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design Patterns

Come up creatively with six different use cases to demonstrate your understanding of the following software design patterns by coding the same:

### Behavioral Design Patterns
1. **Use Case 1**: Stock Market System
2. **Use Case 2**: Payment System with Multiple Payment Methods

### Creational Design Patterns
1. **Use Case 1**: Vehicle Rental Service
2. **Use Case 2**: Configuration Manager for a Multi-User System

### Structural Design Patterns
1. **Use Case 1**: Text Formatting
2. **Use Case 2**: Legacy System Interacting with a Modern API

## Exercise 2: Problem Statements for Mini-Projects

### Mars Rover Programming Exercise

**Problem Statement**:  
Create a simulation for a Mars Rover that can navigate a grid-based terrain. Your Rover should be able to move forward, turn left, and turn right. You'll need to make sure that it avoids obstacles and stays within the boundaries of the grid. Remember to use pure Object-Oriented Programming, design patterns, and avoid using if-else conditional constructs.

#### Functional Requirements
1. Initialize the Rover with a starting position (x, y) and direction (N, S, E, W).
2. Implement the following commands:
   - **'M'**: Move one step forward in the direction the rover is facing.
   - **'L'**: Turn left.
   - **'R'**: Turn right.
3. Implement obstacle detection. If an obstacle is detected in the path, the Rover should not move.
